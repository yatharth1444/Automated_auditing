1. Performance
Go:

Fast Execution: Go is a compiled language, which means it generally runs faster than interpreted languages like Python. If performance is critical, especially for running complex or resource-intensive tasks, Go has the edge.
Concurrency: Go has built-in support for concurrent programming with goroutines, making it ideal for tasks that can be parallelized.
Python:

Slower Execution: Python is an interpreted language, so it's generally slower than Go. However, for many tasks, the speed difference might not be significant enough to be a dealbreaker.
Concurrency: Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a limitation for multi-threaded tasks, although you can use multi-processing or async features for concurrency.
2. Ease of Use and Learning Curve
Go:

Simple Syntax: Go has a clean and simple syntax, but it requires more boilerplate code compared to Python.
Learning Curve: While Go is relatively easy to learn, it has concepts like strict typing, pointers, and concurrency that may take some time to master if you're new to programming.
Python:

User-Friendly: Python is known for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners or for rapid development.
High-Level Abstractions: Python provides a lot of built-in functions and libraries, allowing you to accomplish tasks with minimal code.
3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
Go:

Native Cross-Compilation: Go allows you to easily compile binaries for different operating systems from the same codebase, making it highly suitable for cross-platform applications.
Standard Library: Go’s standard library is robust and provides many cross-platform features out of the box.
Python:

Interpreted Language: Python runs on any platform with a compatible interpreter, which is nearly ubiquitous. However, distributing Python scripts usually requires ensuring the right interpreter and dependencies are installed.
Virtual Environments: Python uses virtual environments for dependency management, which can add complexity when distributing scripts.
4. Ecosystem and Libraries
Go:

Standard Library: Go has a powerful standard library but fewer third-party libraries compared to Python. For system-level programming and networking, Go’s libraries are very strong.
Community and Packages: The Go ecosystem is growing, but you might find fewer libraries for specific tasks compared to Python, especially for things like data analysis or machine learning.
Python:

Rich Ecosystem: Python has an extensive ecosystem with libraries for virtually any task, from web development to data science. For audit scripting, libraries like os, subprocess, shutil, and others are readily available.
Community Support: Python has a vast and active community, making it easy to find support, tutorials, and pre-built solutions for common tasks.
5. Development Speed and Flexibility
Go:

Explicitness: Go forces you to be explicit in your coding, which can reduce bugs but may slow down development initially.
Tooling: Go has excellent tooling for building, testing, and deploying applications, which can streamline the development process.
Python:

Rapid Development: Python’s simplicity and extensive libraries allow for rapid prototyping and development. It’s particularly good for scripting and automating tasks quickly.
Flexibility: Python’s dynamic typing and high-level nature make it very flexible, allowing for fast iteration and experimentation.
6. Deployment
Go:

Static Binaries: Go produces standalone, statically-linked binaries that don’t require external dependencies, making deployment straightforward.
Size: Go binaries can be larger, but they are self-contained, simplifying distribution.
Python:

Interpreter Required: Python scripts typically require a Python interpreter to be installed on the target system, and managing dependencies can be complex.
Packaging: Tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze can bundle Python scripts into standalone executables, but this process can be more involved than with Go.
7. Use Cases
Go:

System-Level Tasks: Go is well-suited for system-level programming, network services, and applications where performance and concurrency are important.
Enterprise and Cloud: Go is increasingly popular for cloud services, microservices, and distributed systems.
Python:

Automation and Scripting: Python excels at writing automation scripts, glue code, and tasks that involve a lot of text processing or interaction with other software.
Data Science and AI: Python dominates in areas like data science, machine learning, and AI, thanks to its vast ecosystem of libraries.
Which One Should You Choose?
Go might be better if:

Performance and concurrency are crucial.
You need a single, self-contained binary for easy deployment.
You're working on system-level tasks or need to interact closely with the OS.
Your team is comfortable with stricter typing and a slightly steeper learning curve.
Python might be better if:

Rapid development and ease of use are your top priorities.
You need to leverage a rich ecosystem of libraries for various tasks.
The project involves a lot of scripting, automation, or interaction with other software.
Your team is more familiar with Python, or you prefer a language that’s easier to learn.
